## Introduction

This project explores clustering techniques to uncover patterns in datasets. We compare three clustering methods:  
1. **K-Means**  
2. **Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM)**  
3. **Hierarchical Clustering**  

Our analysis aims to identify clusters, evaluate algorithm performance, and derive actionable insights from two datasets.

## Datasets

### 1. Wine Quality Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)  
- **Description**: Contains physicochemical properties of red wine, with quality ratings (0â€“10).  
- **Purpose**: Group wines with similar characteristics to help winemakers optimize production processes.  

### 2. Swiss Dataset
- **Source**: Built-in R dataset  
- **Description**: Socio-economic indicators for Swiss provinces.  
- **Purpose**: Use hierarchical clustering to explore regional variations and socio-economic groupings.

## Objectives

1. Implement **K-Means** and **PAM** on the Wine Quality dataset to identify groups with similar physicochemical properties.  
2. Apply **Hierarchical Clustering** on the Swiss dataset to uncover regional patterns.  
3. Compare partitional and hierarchical clustering techniques.  
4. Explore the role of clustering in anomaly detection across fields such as finance and cybersecurity.

## Research Questions

- What are the key differences between density-based (DBSCAN) and grid-based (STING) clustering methods?  
- How can clustering help detect anomalies in fields like finance and cybersecurity?
